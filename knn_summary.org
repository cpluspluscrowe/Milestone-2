* ROC Values

- Model :: KNN

I tested the k hyperparameters from 1 to 7.  A k of 1 always had the best
performance.  

| KNN Models | transactions | products | transactions / products | undersampling |   AUC | K |
|------------+--------------+----------+-------------------------+---------------+-------+---|
|          1 | Yes          | -        | -                       | -             | 0.579 | 1 |
|          2 | -            | Yes      | -                       | -             | 0.589 | 1 |
|          3 | Yes          | -        | -                       | Yes           | 0.591 | 1 |
|          4 | -            | Yes      | -                       | Yes           | 0.557 | 1 |
|          5 | -            | -        | Yes                     | Yes           | 0.581 | 1 |
|          6 | -            | -        | Yes                     | -             | 0.537 | 1 |

- 0.5788 with k = 1 with no total_products

- 0.589 with k = 1 and no total_transactions

- 0.591 with k = 1 with undersampling and no total_products

- 0.557 with k = 1 and undersampling and no total_transactions

- 0.581 with k = 1 and understampling and total_transactions / total_products

- 0.537 with k = 1 with no sampling and total_transactions / total_products

no total transactions is a more simple metric with a similar performance as undersampling.
