* ROC Values

- Model :: KNN

I tested the k hyperparameters from 1 to 7.  A k of 1 always had the best
performance.  

- 0.5894 with k = 1 and no total_transactions

- 0.5788 with k = 1 with no total_products

- 0.591 with k = 1 with undersampling and no total_products

- 0.557 with k = 1 and undersampling and no total_transactions

- 0.581 with k = 1 and understampling and total_transactions / total_products

- 0.537 with k = 1 with no sampling and total_transactions / total_products

no total transactions is a more simple metric with a similar performance as undersampling.
